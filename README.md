# Project Description :bread:
Whenever I go out to eat and I'm having a hard time calculating the right tip, I'll fumble with my phone and search for a "tip calculator" on Google. So to solve that problem I created a calculator application that can calculate how many tips should be given to people. I created this application using __Javascript, HTML, and CSS__.
